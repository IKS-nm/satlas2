Architecture of SATLAS2
=======================

The SATLAS2 architecture has been streamlined and differs enormously from SATLAS. For a way to mostly reuse old SATLAS code, see the :doc:`interface tutorial<../tutorials/interface>`. Help

In SATLAS2, the main object to work with is the :class:`Fitter<satlas2.core.Fitter>` object.
